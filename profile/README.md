# SatSync

SatSync aims to improve the time it takes for Satellite-based Emergency Mapping (SEM) of Natural Disasters to be completed. The current ~3 days wait, is time where coordination  for people on the ground is critical after a natural disaster has occured. This project aims to integrate Web3 technologies into the current space sector to improve:

- A - SEM Activation
- B - Satellite planning and tasking
- C - EO Data Oraclisation and Distribution
